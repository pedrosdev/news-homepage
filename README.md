## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Basic JS for event handling

### What I learned

This was a great opportunity to solidify my knowledge in flexbox, which I have been working with for a few weeks now. Also, this was the first project I made responsive while actually knowing what I was doing (though it might still have some flaws), and one of my first experiences with event handling in JavaScript.

### Continued development

I want to improve my abilities on event handling and DOM manipulation using JavaScript and also use different CSS properties and features on my future projects.
